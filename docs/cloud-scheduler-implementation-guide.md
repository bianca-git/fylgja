## Architecture Overview

The Fylgja Cloud Scheduler architecture represents a sophisticated integration of Google Cloud Platform services designed to provide reliable, scalable, and cost-effective automation capabilities. The architecture follows enterprise-grade patterns while maintaining the simplicity and cost-effectiveness that align with Fylgja's design principles.

### Core Components Integration

The scheduling system is built upon a foundation of interconnected components that work together to provide seamless automation capabilities. The **Cloud Scheduler Service** serves as the central orchestrator, triggering scheduled tasks at precise intervals across multiple timezones. This service integrates with **Google Pub/Sub** to provide reliable message delivery and decoupling between scheduling triggers and task execution.

The **Firebase Cloud Functions** layer provides the execution environment for scheduled tasks, offering automatic scaling, built-in monitoring, and seamless integration with other Firebase services. Each scheduled task is implemented as a dedicated Cloud Function that can be independently monitored, scaled, and maintained. This modular approach ensures that issues with one type of scheduled task do not affect others.

The **Scheduled Tasks Manager** serves as the central coordination point for all automated operations. This component implements sophisticated logic for user timezone handling, quiet hours respect, batch processing optimization, and adaptive scheduling based on user behavior patterns. The manager maintains execution history, performance metrics, and error tracking that enable continuous optimization of the scheduling system.

### Data Flow and Message Processing

The data flow architecture ensures reliable message processing and task execution through a carefully designed pipeline. When Cloud Scheduler triggers a scheduled task, it publishes a message to the appropriate Pub/Sub topic with relevant context information including timezone, task parameters, and execution metadata. The message format is standardized across all task types to ensure consistent processing and monitoring.

Firebase Cloud Functions subscribe to these Pub/Sub topics and process messages asynchronously, providing natural load balancing and fault tolerance. Each function validates the incoming message, extracts task parameters, and delegates execution to the appropriate task handler within the Scheduled Tasks Manager. This architecture ensures that message processing is reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

The task execution pipeline includes comprehensive error handling and retry logic that ensures tasks are completed successfully even in the face of temporary failures. Failed tasks are automatically retried with exponential backoff, and persistent failures are routed to dead letter queues for manual investigation. This approach ensures high reliability while preventing cascading failures.

### Scalability and Performance Considerations

The architecture is designed to handle significant scale while maintaining cost-effectiveness. The use of Cloud Functions provides automatic scaling based on demand, ensuring that the system can handle peak loads without manual intervention. The Pub/Sub integration provides message buffering and load balancing that smooths out traffic spikes and ensures consistent performance.

Batch processing capabilities are implemented throughout the system to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs. User tasks are grouped by timezone and processed in batches, reducing the number of function invocations while maintaining timely execution. The batch size is configurable and can be adjusted based on performance requirements and cost considerations.

Performance monitoring is integrated at every level of the architecture, from individual task execution times to system-wide throughput metrics. This monitoring enables proactive optimization and capacity planning, ensuring that the system continues to perform well as Fylgja's user base grows.

## Scheduling Framework

The scheduling framework represents the core logic that orchestrates all automated tasks within Fylgja. This framework implements sophisticated algorithms for timezone handling, user preference management, and adaptive scheduling that ensure users receive timely, relevant interactions while respecting their individual preferences and constraints.

### Timezone Management and Global Coordination

Timezone management represents one of the most complex aspects of the scheduling framework, requiring careful coordination across multiple geographic regions while maintaining consistency and reliability. The framework implements a multi-layered approach to timezone handling that ensures users receive scheduled interactions at appropriate local times regardless of their geographic location.

The primary timezone strategy involves creating separate scheduled jobs for major timezone regions, including UTC, Eastern Standard Time, Pacific Standard Time, and other significant timezone clusters. This approach reduces the complexity of runtime timezone calculations while ensuring that scheduled tasks execute at appropriate times for the majority of users. Each timezone-specific job includes appropriate offset calculations and daylight saving time adjustments.

For users in less common timezones, the framework implements dynamic timezone conversion that calculates appropriate execution times based on user preferences and current timezone offsets. This calculation includes support for daylight saving time transitions, timezone changes due to travel, and edge cases such as users in regions that do not observe daylight saving time.

The framework maintains a comprehensive timezone database that includes historical timezone information, daylight saving time rules, and future timezone changes. This database is updated regularly to ensure accuracy and includes fallback mechanisms for handling unknown or invalid timezone specifications. The system also implements timezone validation that prevents scheduling errors due to invalid timezone configurations.

### User Preference Integration and Personalization

User preference integration represents a critical component of the scheduling framework that ensures scheduled interactions align with individual user needs and preferences. The framework implements a sophisticated preference management system that considers multiple factors including communication style, preferred interaction times, quiet hours, and engagement frequency.

The preference system begins with comprehensive user profiling that captures individual scheduling preferences during the onboarding process. Users can specify their preferred times for daily check-ins, reminder frequency, summary delivery preferences, and quiet hours during which they do not want to receive automated messages. These preferences are stored in a structured format that enables efficient querying and processing during task execution.

Adaptive learning capabilities are integrated throughout the preference system, enabling Fylgja to learn from user behavior and adjust scheduling accordingly. The system tracks user response patterns, engagement levels, and interaction timing to identify optimal scheduling windows for each individual user. This learning process is gradual and respectful, making small adjustments over time rather than dramatic changes that might disrupt user experience.

The framework implements sophisticated quiet hours management that respects user preferences while ensuring important communications are not missed. Quiet hours can be configured with different rules for different types of messages, allowing urgent reminders to override quiet hours while respecting user preferences for routine check-ins. The system also includes buffer periods around quiet hours to avoid messages that arrive just before or after the specified quiet period.

### Dynamic Question Generation and Variety

Dynamic question generation represents a key differentiator for Fylgja's scheduling system, ensuring that users receive varied, engaging, and contextually appropriate prompts rather than repetitive automated messages. The framework implements sophisticated algorithms for question selection, phrasing variation, and contextual adaptation that maintain user engagement over extended periods.

### Adaptive Scheduling and Learning Algorithms

Adaptive scheduling represents an advanced capability that enables Fylgja to optimize scheduling based on user behavior patterns and engagement metrics. The framework implements machine learning algorithms that analyze user interaction data to identify optimal timing, frequency, and content for scheduled interactions.

The learning algorithms consider multiple data points including response times, engagement levels, completion rates, and user feedback to build comprehensive models of individual user preferences. These models are updated continuously as new interaction data becomes available, enabling the system to adapt to changing user patterns and preferences over time.

Scheduling optimization algorithms use these user models to adjust timing, frequency, and content of scheduled interactions. For example, if a user consistently responds to morning check-ins but ignores evening ones, the system will gradually shift toward more morning interactions. Similarly, if a user shows higher engagement with deeper reflection questions, the system will increase the frequency of such questions.

The adaptive system includes safeguards to prevent over-optimization that might lead to reduced variety or inappropriate scheduling changes. The algorithms implement gradual adjustment mechanisms, minimum variety requirements, and user override capabilities that ensure the system remains helpful and engaging rather than becoming too narrowly focused.
